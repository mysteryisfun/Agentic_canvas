The "board" in your project is envisioned as a **dynamic, interactive digital blackboard** that serves as the primary visual interface for the AI teaching assistant. [cite_start]Its core purpose is to replicate and enhance the capabilities of a human teacher using a traditional blackboard, but with the added power of real-time AI-generated multimedia content and adaptive guidance[cite: 1, 8, 10, 97, 98, 102].

Here's an in-depth explanation of the board and its requirements for your project:

### Capabilities of the Board

The board's capabilities are designed to create an immersive and highly personalized learning experience:

* [cite_start]**Multi-Modal Content Generation & Display:** The board can dynamically render and display various forms of content in real-time[cite: 8, 11, 65, 98]:
    * [cite_start]**Text Explanations:** Displaying step-by-step textual explanations, similar to a teacher writing on a blackboard[cite: 20].
    * [cite_start]**High-Quality Images:** Generating and displaying relevant images on the fly to visualize concepts[cite: 8, 22, 106].
    * [cite_start]**Videos:** Embedding and playing videos to provide richer explanations[cite: 8, 106].
    * [cite_start]**Interactive 3D Models/Animations:** Rendering complex 3D models and animations which is only the THREE.js library, allowing for visual exploration of concepts (e.g., a 3D solar system)[cite: 8, 23, 104, 106].
    * [cite_start]**Dynamic JavaScript Commands:** Executing JavaScript commands to create custom line drawings, diagrams, charts, or other interactive elements on the fly[cite: 24, 106]. This mimics a teacher drawing on the board.
* [cite_start]**Dynamic Manipulation and Control:** The AI "Canvas Agent" has complete control over the board[cite: 26, 102, 158]:
    * [cite_start]**Real-time Addition, Editing, Removal, and Movement:** Elements (text, images, videos, 3D assets) can be added, modified (e.g., updating text content), removed, and repositioned dynamically on the canvas as the lesson progresses[cite: 10, 102, 71].
    * [cite_start]**Contextual Focus and Orientation:** For 3D models, the AI can control the camera, zoom, pan, and specifically highlight or focus on particular parts of the 3D asset to match the ongoing contextual topic (e.g., focusing on Saturn when discussing Saturn within a solar system model)[cite: 74, 104, 121, 275].
* [cite_start]**Adaptive Learning Flow Support:** The board facilitates the unique step-by-step adaptive guidance[cite: 12, 109, 258]:
    * It visually presents the current step of the curriculum.
    * When a student requests a deeper explanation, the board can clear or modify the current content related to the original flow and present detailed, expanded content for the specific query. [cite_start]Once the query is addressed, it seamlessly resumes the original learning flow[cite: 72, 109, 114, 115, 265].

### Interactions with the Board

The interactions are primarily driven by the AI, but also incorporate student input:

* **AI-Driven Interaction (from the "Canvas Agent"):**
    * [cite_start]The "Manager Agent" sends all content and instructions to the "Canvas Agent" (which controls the frontend board)[cite: 25, 150].
    * [cite_start]The Canvas Agent dynamically renders text, images, plays audio (synchronized with visuals), and manages user interaction with 3D models[cite: 26, 157].
    * It's like the AI is "writing" and "drawing" on the board in real-time, responding to the lesson plan and student queries.
* **User Interaction:**
    * **Passive Viewing:** Students primarily view the dynamic content presented by the AI on the board.
    * [cite_start]**Interactive with 3D Models:** Users can interact with 3D models (e.g., rotate them) on the board[cite: 26, 163].
    * [cite_start]**Pausing for Deeper Explanation:** A crucial interaction point is the student's ability to "pause" the main learning flow at any step and ask for detailed explanations on a specific part[cite: 27, 72, 109, 114, 258, 265]. This input then signals the backend to generate new, more granular content for the board.

### Working of the Board (Simplified Flow)

1.  [cite_start]**User Input:** A student selects a topic and desired content level[cite: 17].
2.  [cite_start]**Curriculum Planning (Backend):** A "Manager Agent" informs a "Planning Agent" (LLM) which devises a step-by-step curriculum[cite: 18, 141, 142].
3.  [cite_start]**Content Generation (Backend):** For each step of the curriculum, specialized "Content Agents" (Text, Image, Video, Three.js, JS Agents) generate the appropriate multimedia content based on the command from the "Manager Agent"[cite: 19, 41, 144, 147, 149, 152, 154].
4.  [cite_start]**Command Transmission (Backend to Frontend):** The "Manager Agent" receives all generated content and instructions and sends them as specific commands to the "Canvas Agent" (which is your frontend board)[cite: 25, 150]. These commands specify what content to add, update, remove, or manipulate on the board.
5.  **Dynamic Rendering (Frontend Board):** The frontend "Canvas" component receives these commands via WebSocket. [cite_start]It then updates its internal state, and based on this state, it dynamically renders text, loads images, embeds videos, initializes and manipulates 3D models using Three.js, and executes JavaScript commands to draw or create interactive elements[cite: 26, 157].
6.  **Adaptive Loop:** This process loops. [cite_start]If a student asks for more detail on a specific step, the "Manager Agent" re-plans, and new content is generated and sent to the board to provide that deeper explanation, temporarily altering the visual flow before resuming the original curriculum[cite: 27, 72, 109, 114, 115].

### Final Output and Expected Experience

[cite_start]The final output is a **highly immersive, personalized, and responsive learning experience**[cite: 28, 59, 67].
* [cite_start]Students will perceive the board as a patient, adaptable virtual tutor that can "draw" and "explain" concepts visually in real-time, much like a human teacher[cite: 64, 94, 97].
* [cite_start]The learning content is not static; it dynamically builds and adapts based on user input and pace[cite: 27, 65].
* [cite_start]The synchronized display of visuals (images, videos, 3D) with voice explanations creates a rich, multi-sensory learning environment that overcomes challenges like language barriers and the static nature of current digital learning[cite: 6, 8, 14, 65, 95, 98].
* [cite_start]It effectively becomes a "personalized YouTube for learning," where the AI dynamically constructs lessons tailored to the individual, providing an accessible, engaging, and effective solution for learning anytime, anywhere[cite: 28, 30, 65, 109].
