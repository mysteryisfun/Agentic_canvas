Project: Agentic Canvas Frontend

Last completed milestone: **Phase 3 - Rendering Basic Elements**.

The application can now:
- Connect to a WebSocket server.
- Manage a global state of canvas elements.
- Render `text` and `image` elements sent from the server.

Next step is **Phase 4: Rendering Complex Elements (Video & 3D Models)**.
